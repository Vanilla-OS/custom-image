# Custom Vib Image

This template repository is a starting point for creating custom [Vib images](https://github.com/Vanilla-OS/Vib) on top of [official vanilla images](https://images.vanillaos.org) like [desktop image](https://github.com/Vanilla-OS/desktop-image). It contains a basic recipe and an example module to get you started.

It is suggested to check the [Vib repository's README](https://github.com/Vanilla-OS/Vib?tab=readme-ov-file#recipe-format) to know more about the recipe format, structure of modules and the supported fields.

## Getting Started

- First, click on the <kbd>Use this template</kbd> button in the top right corner, then from the drop-down menu select <kbd>Create a new repository</kbd>. This would create a new repository with the same files and directories as this repository.
- Go to **Settings → Actions → General** and ensure "_Allow all actions and reusable workflows_" are enabled.
- Now, clone the repository to your local machine and let's start customizing your image. You can also use the GitHub online editor if you prefer.
- Open the `vib-build.yml` workflow file and replace the custom image name with an image name of your choosing in line 14.
- Open the `recipe.yml` file and replace the image name and ID with your image name and ID in lines 1 and 2.
- Now, perform your additions and modifications to the recipe as per your requirements.
- If you just want to install `.deb` files, you can just put them in `includes.container/deb-pkgs`
- Optionally, add your modules to the `modules` directory and add them to the package-modules `includes` in `recipe.yml`.
- You can check the Actions tab in GitHub to see the build progress of your image.

> [!NOTE]
> It is suggested to add `vib-image` and `vib` tags to your repository for your image to be easily discoverable to others.

## Use your custom image

If your image is successfully built, you can then point ABRoot to your custom image to use it.

- Edit `/etc/abroot/abroot.json` with `host-shell pkexec nano /etc/abroot/abroot.json`.
- Change the "name" entry from something like `vanilla-os/desktop` to `your-github-name/your-image-name` (for example `taukakao/custom`).
- Run `abroot upgrade` to switch to your custom image.

## Explore

Now, that you are aware of the basics, let's explore the files and directories present in this repository:

- `.github/workflows/vib-build.yml`: This file contains the GitHub Actions workflow to check for updates to the base image and build the Vib image.
  - It uses the `vib` action to build the recipe and upload it as an artifact. The generated artifact is then built using Docker and pushed to GHCR.
  - The action runs automatically on a schedule checking updates to the base image using [Differ](https://github.com/Vanilla-OS/Differ).
- `.github/workflows/vib-pr.yml`: This file contains the GitHub Actions workflow to build the Vib image on pull requests.
  - It uses the `vib` action to build the recipe and upload it as an artifact. You can download and view the artifact to verify that your changes are performed as expected.
- `.github/dependabot.yml`: This file contains the configuration for GitHub's Dependabot to check for updates to the GitHub actions used in the workflow files monthly and when it finds a new version it creates a PR in your repository.
- `includes.container`: The files included in this directory are added by default to your image to the specified location. (It also contains ABRoot's configuration file)
- `modules`: This directory contains the modules that are used to customize the image. You can add your modules to this directory.
- `recipe.yml`: This file contains the recipe for the image. It specifies the base image, modules and other fields to be present in the custom image.
